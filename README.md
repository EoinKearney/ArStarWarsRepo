My AR experience is based around Star Wars. The Death Star sits still and you can see the Millenium Falcon with bright blue engine boosters getting chased down by multiple TIE fighters as the Star Wars Theme Music plays in the background.
I had the Death Star as the main point of the project and used this as a focal point for the ships to rotate around using some script
I added sound to create a more immersive experience along with some particle effects to the Falcons engine to bring it to life.
